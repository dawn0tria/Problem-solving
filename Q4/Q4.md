# Multiple Txns System Design

You are tasked with designing a system where users can mint NFTs by paying with various tokens, including ETH. The minting contract requires payment in USDC. The solution should allow users to perform the token swap and mint the NFT in a single, smooth user experience, even if the process involves multiple sequential transactions. Consider the case where the user might reload the browser tab during the transaction process.

## Requirements

- **Transaction Management:** Design a mechanism to handle the token swap and subsequent minting transaction.
- **User Experience:** Ensure the process is seamless for the user, minimizing interactions and handling potential disruptions such as page reloads.
- **Persistence:** Implement a strategy to persist the transaction state and resume the process if interrupted.

## Deliverables

1. **High-Level Design:** Provide a high-level design of your solution, including architectural components and their interactions.
2. **Implementation Details:** Outline the key implementation details for both the frontend and backend components.
3. **Architecture Diagram:** Provide an architecture diagram illustrating the components and their interactions.
4. **Challenges and Solutions:** Identify potential challenges in your design and how you would address them.

## High-Level Design and Architecture

- **System Architecture:** Describe how you would architect the system to handle sequential transactions.
- **Frontend-Backend Interaction:** Explain how the frontend will interact with the backend to manage transaction states.
- **Transaction Flow:** Outline the flow of transactions from user interaction to final execution on the blockchain.

## Implementation Details

- **Frontend:** Describe how the frontend will generate and queue transactions, handle user interactions, and manage state persistence.
- **Backend:** Explain the role of the backend in tracking transaction progress, handling state persistence, and ensuring transactions are executed in the correct order.

## Architecture Diagram

- Provide a diagram illustrating the architecture, including frontend, backend, blockchain interaction, and state management components.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenges:**
  - Handling transaction failures and retries.
  - Ensuring security and integrity of the transaction process.
  - Optimizing gas costs and transaction efficiency.
- **Solutions:** Propose solutions to these challenges, explaining your reasoning and approach.
