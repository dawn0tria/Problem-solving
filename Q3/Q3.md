# Problem: Transaction Status Monitoring and Notification System

**Problem Statement**:

You are developing a web3 wallet that supports Ethereum transactions. To enhance user experience, you need to implement a feature that monitors the status of a user's transactions and notifies them of important updates such as confirmations or failures.

Write a function `monitorTransactions` that takes the following inputs:
- `provider`: An initialized ethers.js provider instance.
- `userAddress`: The address of the user whose transactions need to be monitored.
- `notify`: A callback function that takes a message string and sends a notification to the user (e.g., console.log for simplicity).

The function should:
1. Fetch the pending transactions for the given user address.
2. Set up listeners to monitor the status of each transaction.
3. Notify the user with appropriate messages when the transaction status changes.

### Example Input

```javascript
const ethers = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID');
const userAddress = '0xYourAddress';
const notify = (message) => console.log(message);
```

## Constraints

- The function should handle up to 50 pending transactions for the user.
- Assume the provider is properly initialized and connected to the blockchain.
- Use ethers.js to fetch transaction details and monitor their status.
- Monitor transactions only within the last 1000 blocks.
